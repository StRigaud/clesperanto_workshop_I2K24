    - Presenation of the Napari-assistant and pipeline construction
    - Hands-on: processing some image using the assistant and generate a python script
- pyClesperanto:
    - Presentation of the python clesperanto library
    - Exploring and modifying the generated code together
    - Hands-on: GPU-benchmarking competition (who has the fastest GPU?)
- clEsperantoJ:
    - Running our python script in Fiji (Experimental)
